Find here my work regarding various Machine Learning courses I've studied with OpenClassRoom. You'll find basic or more complex studies. More information bellow or in specific comments of each file.

Main topics : regression, classification, supervized/unsupervied learning, overfitting, accuracy, clustering, linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, EDA, preprpocessing, adaboost, xboost, lasso, random forest, ridge, KNN, training/testing, neural networks + all features from Data Science.
 

Directories : 
* datasets : all datasets used in various sandbox, exercices or  kernels;

* exercices : TP and activities submited and evaluated for course accreditations;

* kernels : general or specific work regarding a dataset, a tool, a concept or just for fun (and learn). Could be very basic, easy and short script or more detailed and complex notebook;

 *  sandbox : preparatory work, miscellaneous or unfinished studies, draft code;
